      <h2>Wlecome to My Portfolio!</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Henry Li, a fresh Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Bellevue College, now navigating the tech landscape of Seattle, WA. I'm all about blending creativity with technical expertise in software and web development. My toolkit includes Java, C#, C++, React, and web technologies like JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

My academic journey includes a hands-on project creating a COVID-19 Pandemic Tracker, where I first cut my teeth on React.js, and a Web Development Certification from the University of Washington. These experiences sharpened my skills in responsive design and modern web frameworks.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the basketball court, glued to a football game, or diving into the latest video game. I'm excited to start my professional journey and look forward to connecting with potential employers and fellow tech enthusiasts.
